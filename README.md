# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This project is designed to determine how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relationship to their launch dates and funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### A pivot table was created to show the different number of successes, fails, and cancels within a given year seperated by month.  A line chart was then created to reflect the findings of these campaigns.  

### Goals were sepearted into incremental values and were then analyzed based upon the percentage of successes, fails, and cancels within each of these increments.  A line chart was then created to reflect the findings of these campaigns.  

### There were no challenges in processing the data.  Some potential issues could come in drawing conclusions across countries.  Different ethnic tastes could skew data if the customer were wanting global data.  

## Results


From years 2009 to 2017 there were 4,114 different Kickstarter campaigns.  May held the highest number of successful campaigns (386).  The most successful months on average were May, February, and April which each held a success rate of 60% or higher.  December was the only month to have more failed campigns (118) than successes (111).  September was the only other month to have a success rate of less than 50%.  


Smaller Kickstarter campaigns are witnessing a higher success rate.  Goals set to less than $15,000 have a higher percentage of successes than fails.  The only other range to see higher successes than fails $35,000-$45,000.  


The Kickstarter website states there were 553,042 different projects launched (https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats).  The dataset provided has 4,114 entries.  The data is limited to 2009-2017, but that still leaves around 549,000 different campaings unaccounted.  I don't think those all took place in the last 5-6 years.  This data is a sample.  The parent category is skewed theater as ~33% of the data is from theaters.  Theaters are one of nine parent categories.  How this data was collected and what criteria were used to create this sample is a limitation.


There are myriad ways to analyze this data.  A focus could have been put on category type.  Bar charts could be created to show which types have the most successes.  Countries could have been a focus.  Pivot tables could be created to show the outcomes based upon country.
